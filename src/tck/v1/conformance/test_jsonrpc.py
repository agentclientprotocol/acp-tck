"""JSON-RPC envelope conformance: ACP-JSONRPC-001..005.

Separate from `test_transport.py`/`test_initialize.py` to keep the "jsonrpc:" group of
assertions in one focused file.

custom methods to be (`docs/protocol/v1/draft/extensibility.mdx`) -- the TCK holds its own probe
traffic to the same rule it enforces on agents.
