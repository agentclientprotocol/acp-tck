    selects v2 for any requested version >= 2, including 65535, and its v2 InitializeRequest
    requires `info`; v1-only Rust SDK agents parse `info` for such a request too. Without it

    behind authentication mustn't fail this requirement just because the harness never
    authenticated. That traffic is still captured in `agent.transcript` and validated below.

    `connected_agent` doesn't hand back its own `initialize` result, so this reads the
    session-scoped `agent_initialize_result` fixture (same params/command) purely to decide
