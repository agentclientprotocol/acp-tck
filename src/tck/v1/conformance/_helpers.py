    is just unlikely the cancel will land while the turn is still in flight (see `test_cancel.py`

    it wants (e.g. `session/close`) and return the id used. Whatever else the agent sends while

    dispatcher: nothing sent during an in-flight prompt turn is ever silently dropped. The
    action's response comes back as `PromptTurn.action_response`.

    A subtlety: an agent that emits an update and then *immediately* replies may already have
    written its response before we decide to cancel -- we just haven't read it yet. To keep
    `cancelled_at_index` honest, we give a brief (`cancel_race_peek(timeout)`) look for the

    return it with `cancelled_at_index=None` (a race), as if it arrived before cancel was ever
    considered.

    `extra_params`, if given, is merged into the `session/prompt` request's own params
