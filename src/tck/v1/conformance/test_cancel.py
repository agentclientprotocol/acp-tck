"""Cancellation conformance: ACP-CANCEL-001, ACP-CANCEL-002 (Reqs 25, 26, 28).

`ACP-JSONRPC-003` already covers a bare `session/cancel` (no prompt in flight) getting no
response, so there is no separate `ACP-CANCEL-003` here.

Whether `session/cancel` actually lands while the prompt is still in flight depends on how fast
the agent resolves the turn, which the TCK can't control. `run_prompt` sends `session/cancel` as
soon as the first `session/update` arrives (or `cancel_wait` elapses); `--tck-cancel-prompt`
gives a real agent enough work to still be in flight when it does, but a fast agent can still
finish first.

A raced/unexercised cancellation SKIPs rather than PASSes, since nothing was actually exercised.
"Not exercised" means either: the response was read before `session/cancel` could be sent
(`cancelled_at_index is None`), or the response arrives with a valid, non-`cancelled` stop reason
within the race window (`quiet_period`, from `--tck-timeout`) of when cancel was sent -- the
agent may have finished on its own before reading the notification.

Anything else is judged normally: `stopReason: "cancelled"` PASSes; an error or a late
non-`cancelled` stop reason FAILs.
