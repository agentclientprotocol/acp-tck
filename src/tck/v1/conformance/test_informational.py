"""INFORMATIONAL-tier probes: ACP-INFO-PARSE-001, ACP-INFO-INVALIDREQ-001,
ACP-INFO-UNKNOWNSESSION-001.

The spec is silent on all three behaviours and real SDKs disagree in practice, so none of these
ever assert on the probed behaviour itself -- they exist purely to record what the agent under
test actually does, via `record_property`, for a human reading the report. (They can still FAIL
if the prerequisite handshake -- `initialize`, or `session/new` for
ACP-INFO-UNKNOWNSESSION-001 -- itself fails; that is a real conformance problem the probe
correctly surfaces, not a probe bug.) Each uses its own throwaway `connected_agent` so a bad
reaction (if any) cannot contaminate a later test's connection.

Concluding "the agent stayed silent" uses `quiet_period()`, not the full `--tck-timeout` -- a
v1 TCK must not fail an agent for skipping malformed/non-envelope input (the reference SDK does
exactly that), and must be prepared for "no response at all" without burning the full
per-response deadline to conclude it. The agent's own notifications or requests in that window
are not a reply and are skipped (`_helpers.next_reply_line`).
