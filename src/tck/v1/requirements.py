"""The ACP TCK requirement registry.

Every conformance assertion the TCK makes is backed by exactly one `Requirement` here, keyed
by a stable id (`ACP-<AREA>-<NNN>`). Requirements are *declared*, not derived from code, because
they encode a judgment call about spec text (tier, capability gating) that the schema itself
does not carry. `text`/`citation` come from the protocol specification -- see each entry's
`citation` before changing wording, not memory of the spec.

Conformance tests bind to a requirement via `@pytest.mark.requirement("ACP-…")` (see
`tck.common.plugin`). Two meta-tests (`tests/v1/test_registry.py`) keep this registry and the test suite
in sync: every marker id must exist here, and every id here must be referenced by at least one
test.
