"""ACP v2 (Draft) requirement registry.

Every conformance assertion the TCK makes is backed by exactly one `Requirement` here, keyed
by a stable id (`ACP-<AREA>-<NNN>`). `text`/`citation` come from the protocol specification --
see each entry's `citation` before changing wording, not memory of the spec.

A v1 id is reused bare only when the v2 requirement is truly the *same* one -- same text and
tier, only the citation moving to v2 sources. A changed tier, a changed capability-gate
encoding (e.g. v1's boolean `agentCapabilities.*` flags vs. v2's object-marker
`capabilities.*` paths), or a genuinely different wire shape/rule all count as a different
requirement and get a fresh `2xx` id instead of reusing the v1 number. v1 and v2 keep fully
separate `REGISTRY` dicts, so the same id string can (and does, e.g. `ACP-SESSION-001`/`002`)
carry a different tier per version without conflict.

Every requirement about a method in the `capabilities.session` seven-method baseline
(`session/new`, `session/list`, `session/resume`, `session/close`, `session/prompt`,
`session/cancel`, `session/update`) is `Tier.CAPABILITY`, `capability="capabilities.session"`,
never `Tier.MANDATORY`, regardless of the underlying spec obligation's own MUST-strength
wording -- only `initialize` itself is unconditionally required in v2; the whole session
surface is opt-in via that one capability marker. This applies throughout below and is not
repeated per row.

Conformance tests bind to a requirement via `@pytest.mark.requirement("ACP-…")` (see
`tck.common.plugin`). Two meta-tests (`tests/v2/test_registry.py`) keep this registry and the
test suite in sync: every marker id must exist here, and every id here must be referenced by
at least one test.
