"""Extensibility conformance: `ACP-EXT-001`, `ACP-META-001`, `ACP-SCHEMA-002` (re-cited from v1,
unchanged) plus new hygiene rows `ACP-META-201`, `ACP-EXT-201`, `ACP-EXT-202`, `ACP-EXT-203`.

`ACP-EXT-001`/`ACP-META-001` are connection-level rows with `capability=None`, matching their v1
registry entries; `ACP-META-001`'s test still carries the `capabilities.session` marker since it
drives an actual `session/prompt` turn. `ACP-EXT-201`/`ACP-EXT-203` need only one notification
exchange to probe, and `ACP-EXT-202` only `initialize`'s own result -- none of the three drive a
turn, so none carries a capability marker.

`ACP-META-201` and `ACP-SCHEMA-002` each sweep a full `session/new` + `session/prompt` exchange,
so both tests carry `@pytest.mark.capability("capabilities.session")` even though registry
`capability` stays `None` for both -- the marker only exists so the autouse skip gate doesn't run
them against an agent that never negotiated session support.
