"""Transport hygiene: ACP-TRANSPORT-002, ACP-TRANSPORT-201, ACP-TRANSPORT-203.

Batch-aware v2 counterpart of `tck.v1.conformance.test_transport` (honest duplication, not
shared machinery). v1's rule "every stdout line is exactly one JSON-RPC 2.0 object" widens in
v2 to "...or a non-empty array of them" (`ACP-TRANSPORT-201`, a fresh id since the wording
changed). `ACP-TRANSPORT-002` (UTF-8) is judged identically to v1. `ACP-TRANSPORT-203` (no
embedded newlines) is new to v2.

`_drive_full_exchange` does its own manual `initialize` (mirroring
`test_initialize.py`/`test_batch.py`) and calls `skip_if_version_mismatch` before touching
`session/new`/`run_prompt` -- otherwise a version-mismatched agent that never sends v2's
`state_update` pair would hang every row here until `AgentTimeout`.
