"""Client-capability negative tests: ACP-CLIENTCAP-201 (elicitation MUST NOT be requested in an
unadvertised mode) and ACP-CLIENTCAP-202 (every agent -> client method seen during a turn is a
defined v2 method or `_`-prefixed) -- v2's collapse of v1's `ACP-CLIENTCAP-001/002/003`, since v2
removed `fs/*`/`terminal/*` entirely, so calling them just FAILs as undefined methods.

Both rows are `Tier.CAPABILITY`/`capabilities.session` per the session-baseline tiering rule
(see `tck.v2.requirements`), even though the underlying rules are unconditional MUSTs. The mock
client advertises `capabilities: {}` (no elicitation mode) for every turn here.
