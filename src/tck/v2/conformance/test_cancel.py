"""Cancellation conformance: ACP-CANCEL-201..208, ACP-INFO-CANCEL-201/202.

`ACP-CLOSE-202` is also bound to `test_close_cancels_foreground_work` below, alongside its own
`ACP-CANCEL-208` id -- see `tck.v2.requirements` for why this is a deliberate reuse rather than
a duplicate probe.

v2 confirms cancellation via a terminating `session/update` `state_update {state: "idle",
stopReason: "cancelled"}` notification, not the `session/prompt` response (which is only an
acceptance receipt, `{messageId}`; prompt-lifecycle.mdx:633,640).
`ACP-CANCEL-201/202/203/205/206/207/208` are `Tier.CAPABILITY`, `capability="capabilities.session"`.
`ACP-CANCEL-204` ("as soon as possible") is `Tier.INFORMATIONAL` since promptness has no
wire-observable signal; its test still carries the `capabilities.session` marker for the SKIP
gate and always ends in `pytest.skip(...)`, recording `acp_tck_cancel_sent`/`acp_tck_stop_reason`
first so the always-SKIP isn't vacuous.

**The race, and the honest-SKIP pattern**: `run_prompt(..., on_cancel=True)` fires
`session/cancel` on the transition to `state_update {state: "running"}` (or after `cancel_wait`
elapses if `running` is never observed). `_skip_if_cancel_not_exercised` (below) treats two
situations as **not exercised**, not a defect:

1. `turn.cancelled_at_index is None` -- the turn ended before `session/cancel` could be sent.
2. The cancel *was* sent, but the terminating idle arrives with a valid, non-`"cancelled"`
   `stopReason` within `quiet_period(agent_launch.default_timeout)` -- the agent may simply have
   finished on its own first.

Outside those, cancellation is judged for real. `ACP-CANCEL-201`/`207` (folded into one test)
skip when the turn ended via a JSON-RPC error instead of an idle -- `ACP-CANCEL-203` owns that
diagnostic. `ACP-CANCEL-203`'s registered text deliberately covers both "ends with an error" and
"ends with an idle whose stopReason is a non-cancelled known value" -- an agent resolving with
e.g. `stopReason: "end_turn"` genuinely violates both rows at once, so this overlap is intentional.

`ACP-CANCEL-201`/`207` share one test: a single `stopReason == "cancelled"` check evidences both
201's "MUST send a cancelled idle" and 207's "no illegal substitute value". Safe to share since
both are the same tier and a real defect violates both at once -- unlike `ACP-BATCH-204`/`205`'s
ADVISORY-only sharing (see `test_batch.py`).

`ACP-CANCEL-208` ("`session/close` MUST cancel foreground work first") reuses `ACP-CANCEL-201`'s
evidence shape but triggers via `session/close` (through `run_prompt`'s `on_action`, not
`on_cancel`). It does not duplicate `session/close`'s own result/idempotency rows
(`ACP-CLOSE-201`/`202`) -- only the cancellation side effect.

`ACP-INFO-CANCEL-201`/`202` are `Tier.INFORMATIONAL`: cancelling a session with no foreground
work, and cancelling while `session/request_permission` is pending, are both left unspecified by
the v2 docs. Each records the agent's actual behavior via `record_property` without asserting,
gated on `capabilities.session` purely for the SKIP mechanism.
