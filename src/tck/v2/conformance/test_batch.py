"""JSON-RPC 2.0 batching (v2 §6, `docs/protocol/v2/draft/transports.mdx`): ACP-BATCH-201..208,
ACP-INFO-BATCH-201/202.

New to v2 -- v1 has no batching at all, so none of these ids reuse a v1 number; there is nothing
to reuse. Tiers are documented in full in `tck.v2.requirements`'s "Batching" module docstring
section; see that docstring for the per-id tiering rationale this file does not repeat.

**Every test here calls `skip_if_version_mismatch` on its own manual `initialize`**, unlike
`test_transport.py`/`test_jsonrpc.py`. Those two files' assertions hold for any agent's ordinary
traffic regardless of negotiated version; batching does not; a v1-only agent forced under
`--protocol-version 2` (per `tck.v1.conformance._base`'s `run()`: a top-level JSON array is
silently dropped, `isinstance(message, dict)` gate, no reply at all) would otherwise time out and
FAIL every MANDATORY row in this file, breaking `tests/v2/test_cli.py`'s
`test_v1_conforming_agent_under_protocol_version_2_is_blocked_by_version_mismatch` invariant
(zero FAILs, full `VERSION-MISMATCH:` coverage for every non-negotiation id). `_helpers.
v2_only_agent` implements this "manual initialize + skip on mismatch" pattern.

Batch probes each use their own fresh connection (one `v2_only_agent` per test): a batch line is
exactly the kind of traffic that could crash a less battle-tested agent implementation, and
isolating each probe into its own process means one crash cannot cascade into or pollute a
sibling assertion.

    order; matching is done here by `id`, never by position -- this test's own lookup-by-id
    (rather than assuming array-index correspondence) is exactly the practice `205` calls for,
