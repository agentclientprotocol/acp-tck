"""A defect fixture for ACP-AUTH-207 (MANDATORY): advertises a `type: "terminal"` auth method
whose `env` array has two entries sharing the same `name` -- violating "Names MUST be unique"
(`schema/v2/schema.unstable.json#/$defs/AuthMethodTerminal`). No v1 analogue: v1's terminal auth
descriptor had no `args`/`env` fields at all.

The terminal method is advertised *only* when the connecting client itself advertised
`capabilities.auth.terminal: {}` -- otherwise this fixture would also (correctly) trip
ACP-AUTH-202 on every other connection, muddying the "exactly ACP-AUTH-207" self-test. This
mirrors how ACP-AUTH-202/207 are tested against two different connections in
`test_authentication.py`: the default connection (no terminal capability) sees no `authMethods`
at all from this fixture and is unaffected; the dedicated second connection that does advertise
`capabilities.auth.terminal` is the only one that ever sees the malformed descriptor.
