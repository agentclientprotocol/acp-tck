"""A defect fixture for ACP-AUTH-004 (CAPABILITY, `inferred:authMethods`): otherwise conforming,
advertises a `type: "agent"` auth method and implements `auth/login` normally, but `auth/logout`
always errors. No v1 analogue (v1's logout test had no `--allow-logout` opt-in gate at all).

Must FAIL ACP-AUTH-004 only when run with `--allow-logout` (the flag that actually exercises
`auth/logout`); without it, ACP-AUTH-004 SKIPs like it does for any other agent, since the TCK
never calls the destructive method at all.
