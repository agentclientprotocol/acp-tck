"""A defect fixture for ACP-AUTH-002's MUST NOT: advertises an `authMethods` entry with
`type: "terminal"` unconditionally, even to a client that never advertised
`capabilities.auth.terminal`. v2 port of `tests/fixtures/agents/v1/terminal_auth_unadvertised.py`
(field renamed `id` -> `methodId`).

Fails only ACP-AUTH-002 (MANDATORY): the terminal descriptor itself is otherwise well-formed (no
`args`/`env`), so it does not also trip ACP-AUTH-006 on the dedicated second connection that does
advertise `capabilities.auth.terminal`.
