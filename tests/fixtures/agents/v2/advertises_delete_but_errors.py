"""Non-conforming fixture: advertises `capabilities.session.delete: {}` but `session/delete`
always errors, regardless of the sessionId given.

FAILs `ACP-DELETE-001` (delete of an existing session must succeed), `ACP-DELETE-003` (cascades:
its own `session/delete` call fails the same way before it can compare before/after
`session/list` results), and `ACP-DELETE-002` (ADVISORY: deleting an unknown sessionId should
also succeed silently, but this fixture errors unconditionally). `ACP-DELETE-001`/`003` are
`Tier.CAPABILITY`, so this flips the overall verdict to NOT CONFORMANT; `ACP-DELETE-002` being
ADVISORY does not add to that on its own. Mirrors v1's `advertises_load_but_errors.py`.
