"""Non-conforming fixture: advertises `capabilities.session: {}` (the baseline) but
`session/resume` always errors with a non-`-32601` code, regardless of the sessionId or route
used to obtain it.

Self-test for `obtain_resumable_session`'s all-three-routes-exhausted SKIP behavior:
`obtain_resumable_session`'s three routes (create-then-resume, list-then-resume,
close-then-resume) all end in the same `session/resume` call, so all three fail identically here
-- with a plain `-32603`, never `-32601` (Method not found, which would instead be a hard
`pytest.fail`). `obtain_resumable_session` must exhaust all three routes and then
`pytest.skip(...)`, and every test that routes through it (`ACP-RESUME-201..209`,
`ACP-ADDDIRS-202`) must SKIP together rather than four of them hard-FAILing a false
`NOT CONFORMANT`.
