"""Non-conforming fixture: silently swallows every `_`-prefixed custom method request instead
of sending *any* response (result or error).

FAILs `ACP-EXT-001` (a `_`-prefixed custom method request MUST receive a response of some
shape). Every other method is dispatched normally via `super()`, so the handshake and prompt
turn are unaffected.

Also FAILs `ACP-ERROR-001`: that requirement's own probe is a `_`-prefixed unknown method and
gets no reply at all against this fixture (see `tests/v2/test_cli.py`'s widened `-k` scope for
this fixture). Does NOT cascade into `ACP-BATCH-209`: an array is rejected as a whole, never dispatched
per element.
