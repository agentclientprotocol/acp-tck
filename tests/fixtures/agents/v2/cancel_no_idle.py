"""Non-conforming fixture: hangs on every prompt (not just `__hang__`), and `session/cancel`
itself is silently ignored -- no terminating idle, no error, ever. `session/close` is
unaffected (inherits `ConformingAgent`'s own default `_handle_close_session`, which still
resolves a hanging session via `_finish_turn(..., "cancelled")`), so this fixture isolates
`session/cancel`'s own defect from `ACP-CANCEL-208`'s close-triggered path.

FAILs `ACP-CANCEL-001`/`002`/`203`/`205`..`207`/`209` (each times out inside `run_prompt`,
since the turn never reaches a terminating idle within `--tck-timeout`) and the INFORMATIONAL
`ACP-CANCEL-204` for the same reason (an uncaught `AgentTimeout` is a `FAIL`, not a `SKIP` --
see `AGENTS.md` "Statuses"). `ACP-CANCEL-213` SKIPs instead: it does not judge a turn that never
ends. `ACP-CANCEL-208` and
`ACP-INFO-CANCEL-201` are unaffected: neither one ever calls `session/cancel` on a session this
fixture is holding hostage.
